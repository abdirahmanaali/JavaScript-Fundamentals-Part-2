// ==> STRICT MODE
// is a special mode that we can activate in Javascript to write a secure code
"use strict"; // This is how we write it. It has to be the very 1st statement in the script.
// This makes it easier for us developers accidental errors. Meaning it helps us avoid bugs into our code.
// First it forbids us to do certain things. Second it create visible errors for us
